# ERC-8004 linking (Phase 2)

This page is a placeholder for Phase 2.

Goal: provide a canonical statement and (later) a signed/attested on-chain link between:
- human identity (wallet)
- agent identity (ERC-8004)
- room public key / room id

For now, the Room UI generates a copy-paste JSON statement.
